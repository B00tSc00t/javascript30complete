    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); // works the same as team2

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Rick Smore',
      age: 40
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2= Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      name: 'Rick',

    console.log(rick);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, rick);

    // poor mans deep clone
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(rick));
    // take JSON.stringify and pass it an object. It returns to a string
    // and is no longer an object.
    // Then you immediately JSON.parse it to turn it back into an object
    // to get a full copy of it.
